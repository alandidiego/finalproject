## Description

 - OpenSignal is a new website that allows you to learn crypto, blog, and see the latest trends in cryptocurrency..  We took away the hassle of having to look over multiple websites for the latest info about crypto so we developed a website where itâ€™s all in one place. We offer a smooth intuitive ui and a blog to communicate with other crypto-heads to make navigation of the crypto market so much less time consuming.
